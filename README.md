## 1. Overview

This laboratory activity provides an introductory experience in handling and connecting essential Cisco networking equipment. Participants will work with routers, access points, IP phones, IP cameras, and associated cabling, gaining fundamental skills in device identification, basic setup, and initial configuration.

The focus is to build familiarity with the physical aspects and connection standards of a typical small-to-medium-sized enterprise network.

## 3. Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to:

- Identify core networking devices and cabling.
- Understand the basic purpose and functionality of each device.
- Properly connect networking devices using UTP and serial cables.
- Establish console access to devices for initial setup or troubleshooting.

## 4. Activity Instructions

1. **Device Identification**  
   - Physically examine each device and label its interfaces (e.g., Ethernet ports, console ports).

2. **Physical Connections**  
   - Connect the Cisco 1800 Router to a computer via a serial console cable.
   - Connect the router, access point, IP phone, and IP camera using UTP cables following standard Ethernet practices.

3. **Console Access**  
   - Use terminal emulation software to access the router’s console.
   - Verify connectivity by observing boot sequences or issuing basic commands.

4. **Documentation**  
   - Capture photographs or screenshots of your setup.
   - Document device roles, connection types, and any initial console output.

## 5. Submission Requirements

- A short report detailing:
  - The equipment used and their roles
  - Connection diagrams or labeled photographs
  - Console session screenshots (if applicable)
- Submit your documentation as per the instructor’s guidelines.

## 6. Important Notes

- Handle all equipment with care.
- Ensure all cable connections are secure.
- Always power off devices properly when making hardware changes.
